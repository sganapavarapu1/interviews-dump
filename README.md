2008: Visto (Good Technology): offer made, took it, joined, but left in 3 weeks - because team was just goofying and not working at all ... spending 1/2 day at ping-pong and foosball and rest at cafe... working hardly for 1 hr. Was offered 10% retention bonus if I stay for one year, but refused and returned the sign-on bonus as well.
